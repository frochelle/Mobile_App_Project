# Mobile_App_Project

To unlock the application the user may use his fingerprint.
When I open the data file, I use the private mode, so only the app have access to the file.
I tried to hide the API URL using gradle BuildConfig but unfortunately it didn't compile, so I opted for hidding the url in the string.xml file.
